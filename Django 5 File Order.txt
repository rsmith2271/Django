In a Django 5 web app, the order in which you code your files typically follows the framework’s conventions and best practices. Here's a structured approach to help you build your app efficiently:

1. Project Initialization
Start by creating your Django project:

django-admin startproject myproject

This generates:

manage.py
myproject/ (settings, URLs, WSGI/ASGI)

2. Create Your App(s)
Each functional module should be its own app:

Shell
python manage.py startapp myapp

This creates:

myapp/models.py
myapp/views.py
myapp/urls.py (you’ll create this manually)
myapp/templates/ (for HTML)
myapp/static/ (for CSS/JS)

3. Define Models
Start with models.py:

Define your database schema using Django ORM.
Example:

Python
class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)

4. Register Models in Admin
In admin.py, register your models:

Python
from .models import Product
admin.site.register(Product)

5. Migrations
Run migrations to apply your models to the database:

Shell
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

6. Set Up URLs
In myapp/urls.py:

Python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
]

Include app URLs in myproject/urls.py:

Python
path('', include('myapp.urls')),

7. Write Views
In views.py, define logic:

Python
from django.shortcuts import render

def home(request):
    return render(request, 'home.html')

8. Create Templates
In myapp/templates/, create HTML files:

Interactivity on code previews is coming soon

9. Forms (if needed)
In forms.py (create this file if needed):

Python
from django import forms
from .models import Product

class ProductForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Product
        fields = ['name', 'price']

10. Testing
Use tests.py to write unit tests for your models, views, and forms.

11. Static Files & Media
Configure settings.py for static and media files:

Python
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'

12. Authentication (if needed)
Use Django’s built-in auth system or extend it with custom user models.
